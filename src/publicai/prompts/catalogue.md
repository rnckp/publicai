CATALOGUE CONTRACT 1.0
Return all six identifiers exactly: office_hours, garbage_collection, recycling,
move_in, move_out, problem_reporting.

Minimum structured coverage for supported:
- office_hours: a named office with explicit hours (including an explicit
  appointment-only policy if published) AND a contact channel.
- garbage_collection: at least one waste type with actionable collection
  instructions. Dated entries are optional.
- recycling: at least one material with an explicit disposal route or point.
  Store the disposal route in entries[].instructions or the disposal point in
  entries[].locations, with supporting evidence. A collection-point name in
  label alone, even alongside materials and hours, does not satisfy the
  structured minimum; that inventory remains partial. Review coverage against
  the populated structured fields, not information left only in labels or sources.
  A named collection point IS a disposal point when stored in locations with
  evidence identifying it as the destination for those materials. No street
  address, coordinates or extra disposal instructions are required in that case.
  For example: materials=[Glas], locations=[Sammelstelle Beispiel] with an excerpt
  explicitly linking Glas to that point meets the minimum, even if label repeats
  the same point name. With that name only in label and no locations/instructions,
  it does not. Do not reject a supported locations field merely because it is a name.
- move_in: explicit registration guidance AND an official contact or registration
  destination. A page/form title alone is a service handoff, not guidance.
- move_out: explicit deregistration guidance AND an official contact or
  deregistration destination. Form labels alone are not procedural requirements.
- problem_reporting: an explicitly documented reporting channel AND its stated
  purpose. A general contact address alone is insufficient.

Coverage partial: substantive cited data below minimum or unresolved conflicts.
Coverage handoff_only: specific official destination without usable guidance.
Coverage unavailable: neither structured guidance nor a specific handoff found.

Conflicts preserve evidence-backed alternatives only in conflicts, never in
entries or definitive validity dates. Such retained alternatives may pass review
with status conflicting if each excerpt really supports the stated alternative;
unresolved conflicts do not by themselves forbid a partial package. Do not set
blocking issues for faithfully reported gaps or these retained alternatives.

Coverage metadata must reflect actual discovered facts. zone_required requires
published zone dependence; never invent geographic mappings. limitations and
missing_reasons describe acquisition/coverage gaps only, never add municipal
facts outside evidence-backed fields. explicitly_not_offered is allowed only if
the cited text directly says so. Treat empty data as unknown, not not-offered.
Review these metadata paths as carefully as facts. Published date validity must
explicitly establish complete interval coverage; first/last observed dates do not.
